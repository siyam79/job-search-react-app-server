### Unique Feature 1
#### When the user clicks on the "Bid Now" button, a form will be displayed. The user can enter their proposed rate, specify the price range, and outline the parameters for completing the task. If a user clicks on the "View Bids" button, they will be directed to a page where all submitted bids are visible. Only the person who posted the job can manage the bids, having the authority to accept or reject them.


### Unique Feature 1
#### Upon clicking the "Accept" button for a specific bid, the user expressing interest in the job will transition to a pending status. If the employer confirms the acceptance, the status will change to complete. Conversely, if the "Reject" button is clicked, the bid for the job will be canceled, and the corresponding data will be removed from consideration. This process ensures effective handling of bids and facilitates clear communication between job posters and potential bidders
